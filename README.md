# AI Shop Assistant: Warehouse Navigation and Invoice Generation with Alexa Integration

## Introduction
The AI Shop Assistant is an innovative solution designed to streamline the shopping experience by integrating artificial intelligence with voice-enabled technology. Powered by Alexa, our assistant helps users effortlessly locate items within a warehouse and conveniently generate invoices through simple voice commands.

## Key Features

1. **Item Locator**: Users can easily find the location of specific items within the warehouse by simply asking Alexa. The assistant supports searching by item name, description, or characteristics, ensuring efficient navigation.

2. **Invoice Generation**: With the AI Shop Assistant, users can create invoices on-the-go by verbally adding items to their shopping list. Once completed, the assistant generates a detailed invoice that can be conveniently received on the user's phone.
## How to Use

1. **Item Search**: To find the location of an item, simply ask Alexa where the item is stored. You can specify the item by its name, description, or characteristics.

    Example: "Where is the simple bed?" or "Where can I find a sink?"

2. **Invoice Creation**: Users can add items to their shopping list and create an invoice with ease using voice commands.

    Example: 
    - "Add item 33 to the invoice."
    - "Add 3 units of item 2 to the invoice."
    - "Finish the invoice."

3. **Receive Invoice**: Once the invoice is finalized, it will be sent directly to the user's phone for easy reference.
